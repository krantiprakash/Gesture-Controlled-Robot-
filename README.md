**Gesture Controlled Robot**
**Overview**
The "Gesture Controlled Robot" project allows users to control a mobile robot using hand movements. By utilizing two NodeMCU devices and an IMU sensor, the system enables wireless communication to move the robot based on gestures. This approach makes it easier and more intuitive to interact with robots, with potential applications in education and remote operations.

**Key Features**

1.) Gesture-Based Control: Move the robot by simply moving your hand.

2.) Wireless Control: Use Wi-Fi to send movement data between two NodeMCU devices.

3.) Easy Setup: Connect NodeMCU to a motor driver for the robot and an IMU sensor for hand movement detection.

4.) Arduino IDE: Both devices are programmed using Arduino IDE.

**Setup**
1.) Hardware Needed:
-
-2 NodeMCU devices

-1 IMU sensor (MPU6050)

-Motor driver (L298N)

-Oled

-Robot chassis and motors


2.) Software Needed:
-
-Arduino IDE for programming the NodeMCU

-Wi-Fi network for communication

3.) Instructions:
-
-Connect the NodeMCU to the motor driver on the robot.

-Attach the IMU sensor to the NodeMCU worn on your hand.

-Program both NodeMCUs using Arduino IDE and connect them to the same Wi-Fi network.
